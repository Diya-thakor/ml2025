## Can you give an example of a project question?

**Example: Activity Classifier**
1. Build a classifier for activities (walking, running, etc.)
2. Start with publicly available datasets
3. Collect your own data using smartphones
4. Train and evaluate your personalized classifier
5. *Optional:* Deploy the classifier on your smartphone
